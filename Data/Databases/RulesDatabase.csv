Rule
"The goal is to get to One Piece, the final level of the hunt. Only one person can obtain One Piece and the game ends after it has been obtained. After the game has ended, the remaining positions will be awarded as per the points obtained."
"Answering each question correctly yields 400 points. A skip card can also be bought from the shop for 600 points. The use of a skip card will, quite obviously, skip the current level."
"Hints will be released publically on the Discord Server. No individual hints will be given, however you can confirm leads from the goons at any time (unless mentioned otherwise on the Discord Server)."
"Teaming will be allowed, however teams must be declared before the hunt begins on the Discord Server. Any cross teaming after the hunt begins will result in a ban and disqualification from the hunt."
"Usage of any outside help or unfair means will also lead to a ban and disqualification. Using the internet for information gathering, decryption and other non-communicative methods is allowed, however using any forums, chatrooms or other communicative means is strictly prohibited."
